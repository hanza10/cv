  <p>I was involved in a competition, where I had to create and design a website. Although I didn’t win due to the website not being compatible with different devices, I have learned many skills including featuring a weather API.  I have worked with Boston Borough council to create two topic webpages for their website. As well as creating the webpages I learned how important it was to test the pages functionality and useability. 
On my course I have learned basic python and C# skills, number systems such as binary and binary coded decimal, systems development lifecycle and HTML/CSS skills.
